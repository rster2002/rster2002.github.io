# Chapter 11 - Build a Small Network

[TOC]

## Network Design

### Redundency

The act of making sure when one device stops working, the network can still function. We do this because:

* A network should ne reliable by design
* A outage is costly

## Security

### Network

Examples of security threats:

* Information theft
* Data loss or Manipulation
* Identity Theft
* Disruption of Service

### Physical Security

* Hardware (physical damage to devices, addess to ports)
* Enviormental (temperature, humidity)
* Electrical (votage spikes, power loss)
* Maintainance (poor cabeling and labeling)
