But I am NOT among them, eh wot! Though called a \"crab,\" this beast is an arthropod and thus more akin to spiders and scorpions! Its long tail resembles a scorpion stinger, in fact! Though it's quite harmless, they say. A \"living fossil,\" the horseshoe crab has been around since before the dinosaurs. With that tank-like shell, I suppose it WOULD be the one to survive. But here's what truly rattles me to my beak... During breeding season, horseshoe crabs crawl up on the beach and make nests together in the hundreds. HUNDREDS OF HORSESHOE CRABS! And with that I can say no more.","times":[[0,4],[21,24]]},{"type":"seaCreature","locations":["Ocean"],"name":"Sea pineapple","id":"sea-pineapple","monthsAvailable":[4,5,6,7,8],"icon":"https://acnhapi.com/v1/icons/sea/37","image":"https://acnhapi.com/v1/images/sea/37","sellPrice":1500,"size":"Small","museumFact":"Try not to gawk as you look upon the sea pineapple. Its peculiar look is simply one of nature's many jokes. Though it may look like a half-rotten hunk of fruit, the sea pineapple is no plant, shellfish, or even sea slug. It's a tunicate, wot wot...a fancy name for a shallow-water filter feeder with a taste for plankton. It should be noted that the sea pineapple looks like a tadpole when it's young and can still swim about. Alas, its youthful cuteness wears off once it attaches itself for good to a rock. Ah, but let's put insults aside! Sea pineapples are full of water, you sea. And I fear we're asking for a squirt in the eye!","times":[[0,24]]},{"type":"seaCreature","locations":["Ocean"],"name":"Spotted garden eel","id":"spotted-garden-eel","monthsAvailable":[5,6,7,8,9,10],"icon":"https://acnhapi.com/v1/icons/sea/38","image":"https://acnhapi.com/v1/images/sea/38","sellPrice":1100,"size":"Small","museumFact":"The spotted garden eel is a small eel-shaped fish that loves to burrow in the sandy ocean floor. These silly things are known for popping their heads out of the sand to nibble on plankton drifting by. Some say this makes them look like plants sprouting in a garden...hence the name spotted garden eel.

I daresay Venus' flower basket is one of nature's most impressive works of art.","times":[[0,24]]}]}
