<h1>Getting started</h1>
<p>First of all, you should download the latest version of BSS, which can be found <a onclick="window.open('https://github.com/rster2002/BSS/releases/latest')">here</a>.</p>
<p>Once you've installed BSS and opened it, you need to create a project. Click on 'add project' in the top-left corner. It will pop-up a dialog which will ask you for a project name, a namespace and a workspace and export directory. The workspace directory is where all of your un-compiled BSS code will be. The export directory will be where it compiles everything to. Then click on add.</p>
<p>A new page will show with text that says: 'Nothing compiled yet...'. That's fine! Let's first setup our workspace. First, let's add a 'index.js' file. Although BSS mainly works with 'mcfunction' files, it needs 'Javascript' files to tie everything together. It also acts as a place where we can change some behavior of the compiler.</p>
<p>Let's start by adding this into our 'index.js' file:</p>
<div class="code">
	<p class="title">Javascript</p>
	<p>
		<span class="bsscommand">_r</span><span class="handeler">.</span><span class="bssexpression">use(<span class="number">"index.mcfunction"</span>);</span>
	</p>
</div>
<p>This is all we need to worry about right now. We will come back to javascript files when we dive into the more advanced aspects of BSS, but for now, let's leave it like it is.</p>
<p>Now we can start using BSS. Let's create a file called 'index.mcfunction' (in the same folder as 'index.js') and add this to our file:</p>
<div class="code">
	<p class="title">Bluestone Script</p>
	<p>
		<span class="bssexpression">{{ <span class="bsscommand">as</span> <span class="selector">@a[tag=fighter]</span> <span class="handeler">||</span> <span class="selector">@a[tag=barbarian]</span> <span class="handeler">=></span> }}</span> <span class=""><<</span><br/>
		&emsp;<span class="bssexpression">{{ <span class="bsscommand">@damage</span> <span class="handeler">=></span> }}</span> <span class=""><<</span><br/>
		&emsp;&emsp;<span class="bssexpression">{{ <span class="bsscommand">var</span> <span class="score">chance</span> <span class="handeler">=</span> <span class="number">math.random(1,100)</span> }}</span><br/>
		&emsp;&emsp;<span class="bssexpression">{{ <span class="bsscommand">if</span> <span class="score">chance</span> <span class="handeler">>=</span> <span class="number">75</span> <span class="handeler">=></span> }}</span> <span class="bsscommand">effect</span> <span class="">give</span> <span class="selector">@s</span> <span class="">strength</span> <span class="number">5</span> <span class="number">2</span><br/>
		&emsp;>><br/>
		>>
	</p>
</div>
<p>Here if a player is a fighter or a barbarian, it checks if the player has taken damage and then generates a random number between 1 and 100 and if the result is bigger or quals 75, the players gets strength 3 for 5 seconds.</p>
<p>Now let's go back to BSS. It should have already compiled it for you and it should say: 'Compiled 1 out of 1 files'. If it doesn't say that, click on 'build' in the top-left corner.</p>
<p>Now check your export page. It should have a file called 'index.mcfunction'. These are the bare basic's of using BSS. If you want to learn more, just look around on this wiki.</p>
